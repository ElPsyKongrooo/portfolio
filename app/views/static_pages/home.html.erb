	Hey! The name's Sharlyn Igloria currently a Computer Science student, an aspiring Software Engineer. 
	I'm in love with books and how it takes you to different dimensions. 
	I'm passionate about music, especially in these genres: Indie Rock, Indie Pop, Alternative Rock, Electronic Music, and Electronic Dance Music. 
	I love watching anime and amazed by how much artistry these shows offers and how it depicts a real life knowledge in an animated world.   
	I have an introvert mind trapped in a semi extrovert body.  
	I love taking random pictures depicting just how simple life is if you view it in a more positive perspective. 
	I love the view of the ocean and the view of the sky.  
	I envision a life where everyone has the freedom to be the artist they choose to be.  
	I do my best in things with the goal of giving back to my parents and give them a chance to tour around the world with me.  
	I am a happy go lucky type of person, willing to learn and willing to impart my knowledge to those who needed it. 
	I value attitude more than intelligence. 
	Lastly, I believe that everything is possible if you think that it is and you put your heart in it. 
	Dream is not just a dream if you work hard to achieve it.
